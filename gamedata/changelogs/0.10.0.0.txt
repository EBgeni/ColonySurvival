0.10.0.0 (2023-10-13)

Welcome to  Update 0.10.0: Rails, Roofs and the Rest! This update adds a lot of decorative content like doors and window frames, a paint system, proper rails, Archimidean screws, new recipes/science/a job to access all this new content, and much more. Have fun, and let us know on Discord (discord.gg/colonysurvival) or the Steam Forum if you encounter any new issues! 

- Added "proper" rails: corners, slopes, intersections and gates to prevent NPC walking into your base over the rail tracks
- Added pillars
- Added the Archimedean Screw, that removes water adjacent to it and stops spread of water near it.
- Added signs (ground, wall, roof variants)
- Added fences (can't be walked over by NPCs)
- Added doors (also used by monsters, single door & double door variants)
- Added diagonal roof blocks
- Added flowerbox (ground, window versions)
- Added windows (no translucent effect, just a frame)
- Added street lanterns (ground, side, roof versions)
- Added paint system/items - works on multiple of the new items to create color variants
- Added 'corbels' (support block)
- Added stone/wood stair blocks
- Added crown moulding
- Added the Artist (job that produces many of the new items)
- Added science entries related to the new items (of course)
- Added a mesh for the dyer's job block

- Majorly updated Korean, French, German and Ukrainian localisation, and minor updates for various others (thanks to your submissions!) 

- Updated networking from an older (deprecated) steam P2P API to the newer steam networking API
-- This allowed chunk sending to be changed to be throttled much more accurately. Should lead to more stable server connections when moving about.
- Reworked the input system & UI to better support controllers. This is a work in progress - various parts do not yet work (notably, the stockpile inventory, science tab etc)
- Introduced a limit on the amount of non-block items being rendered in one frame. Currently set to +-100k blocks. This should help performance significantly when colonies are in view with a huge amount of farms and such.

- Reduced fishing efficiency
- Fix a backwards compatibility issue, where a fresh install of 0.9.0+ will cause a black screen on reverting to 0.8.1 due to changes to gamedata/savegames/clientversion.json
- Fix accuracy of the slider used for science conditions (it was cut off a bit)
- Fix night grenade launcher guard being listed as day grenade launcher guard
- Fix a simulation speed bug, where it would slow down when not needed
- Fix a bug where a client could obtain the water item by doing rapid block edits around water that's actively spreading (ping/desync related)
- Fix NPCs rendering beyond the draw distance when set to lower settings
- Fix alarmbell block not requiring a solid block below
- Fix `/time add` command being able to move the time to negative values
- Fixed typo in the log message of the /backup command
- Optimised NPC movement on the server
- Optimised client lit block rendering logic a bit
- Optimised rendering of non-block items to take advantage of multiple threads
- Optimised NPC networking logic to reduce network data sent when moving in a straight line
- Optimised NPC networking logic to do less work when there are no players nearby
- Optimised NPC logic updates - they now indicate when they want to be updated, instead of being polled for updates every frame
- Updated steam API version
- Updated Unity version
- Reorganised the json config files a bit, they're now in Colony Survival/gamedata/baseconfig/, and they're split into various parts.
- Added support for the "color" tag on meshed blocks (applies uniform vertex colors if the mesh has none)
- Added a system where mesh UV coordinates below -8 on both X & Y will ignore the texture and return a neutral texture instead
-- This means you can re-use textures of existing blocks for partial texturing a block without having to include a white bit in the texture

0.10.0.1 (2023-10-13)
- fix inventory toggle button not exiting the inventory when in it
- fix confirm delete world button not working

0.10.0.2 (2023-10-13)
- fix an issue loading older per-world permission files, causing them to reset on changing permissions

0.10.0.4 (2023-10-14)
think I skipped either .2 or .3, whatever
- Prevent rebindings keys to the left/right mouse button, to prevent breaking UI navigation
- Moved rebinding storage from "unity playerpref" (stored in the registry) to gamedata/savegames/controls.json. Should gracefully load & move existing rebindings
- Localised the action descriptions in the key rebinding UI

0.10.0.5 (2023-10-15)
sunday edition
- Added an invert left/right mouse toggle option to the controls menu

0.10.0.6 (2023-10-16)
- Fix starving colonists not actually starving but getting stuck trying to starve
- Fix log errors in the main menu when pressing buttons assigned to ingame actions
- Fix pressing the key bound to the inventory tab while typing in the filter in the statistics menu changing the tab to the inventory
- Fix 'colony tab' key not working when the UI is open (to close it or to switch to it)
- Allow crouching while in a menu, fixes getting uncrouched when you open a menu in a railcart
- Pressing jump now untoggles crouch if it's toggled
noted issue with 0.10.0:
Binding left-ctrl to toggle-crouch works, until you reload the config. It unbinds hold-crouch from the same left-ctrl, but on reloading this gets reset for some reason. Future me problem.

0.10.0.7 (2023-10-18)
- Fix rail going directly from a station into a downward slope not working
- Moved Archimedean screw thingy to essentials category
- Fix a regression causing the game to freeze if it tries to render meshes that haven't got vertex colors and also no type color defined (mod problem)
- Improved error logging when the client has problems loading meshes

0.10.0.8 (2023-11-07)
After much delay, head scratching, learning and discovery
Fully reworked the logic around roof selection/placement.
Should work more consistently, especially with funny shapes.
There's still setups that won't work because there's a limit to the amount of different roof shapes that are in the game.
Hopefully the next updates are quicker

0.10.0.9 (2023-11-07)
- Fix a chance for npcs to freeze upon switching jobs
- Change fences to use the wood placement/removal audio instead of the stone ones
- Change windows to use the wood place/delete audio instead of stone ones
- cs-CZ locale update
- fr-FR locale update
- Made the fisherman 4x as quick, and make the recipe to cook fish require 4 rawfish instead. Workaround for the fisherman not supporting interrupted crafting, and staying to finish at sunset.
- The automatically added outside corner for crown moulding now gets automatically removed on adjacent moulding removal
- Slightly reduced the red-ness of the red texts at various places of the UI
- Fix the client getting stuck in the connection screen when joining servers over the internet and using the wrong password

0.10.0.10 (2023-11-09)
- Fix an issue where the menu would navigate by itself after opening if you previously closed it while holding WASD
- Added some stick deadzone to the gamepad controls
- Fixed the workshop content uploader not showing multiplayer worlds for uploading
- Add back the "chain-placing construction jobs" held button (see control settings ingame)

0.10.0.11 (2023-11-14)
- Changed roof corner shapes to consider matching with solid blocks to their "back" side
- Fix visual glitches on overlapping architrave block tops
- Fix glitchy results when builders were used to place pillars

0.10.0.12 (2023-11-24)
- Fix a possible bug with archimedes screw entity loading
- Fix monster spawning being 3% too low when you have quite high threat at one outpost
- Optimise some meshing code to reduce duplicate work (basically was meshing the world twice on load)
- Updated some missed red texts to be a bit less red for readability reasons
- Another update to the architrave mesh in an attempt to make it less glitchy :)
- Fix banner safe radius visualisation error; blocks up were shown as safe 1 too (top block of a high stair)

0.10.0.13 (2024-01-03)
Update should be backwards/forwards compatible with 0.10.0.12 server/client mixes; but both should be updated to get the full benefits.
- Add an "block attachment system", and make many non-cube blocks use it.
- This allows placement of lanterns, torches, signs etc on top of fences & many more interactions like this
- Crouching now stops the crafting limits UI from opening when you click on job blocks
- Fix slight misaligment in pillar meshes (bottom / top / middle parts)
- Inside corner crown moulding now drops 2 items on removal, as it requires placing 2 to be made
