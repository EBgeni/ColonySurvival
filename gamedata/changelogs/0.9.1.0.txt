0.9.1.0 (2023-03-17)

- Overhaul pathfinding a bit. Paths should be a little more accurate.
- Monster spawning should work consistently with long paths (mazes), and it should run quicker when spawning many monsters.
- Siege mode should now trigger during the day as well, and has chat messages again (until the notifications menu is implemented properly in a later update)
- Siege mode penalty now scales with the outposts' threat instead of with the outposts' colonist count
- Boosted elevator (both kinds) speeds significantly, but reduce their starting speed a little. Default to accelerating to max speed if forward/back are not held.

- Fix some debug commands requiring disabling of achievements despite not being beneficial (like /debug resetresearch)
- Fix an issue with server simulation time auto adjustment, slowing down more than was needed for the server to maintain it's tick rate
- Fix a minor memory leak on the server
- Fix an issue with editing/removing diplomacy rules in multiplayer
- Fix a secondary issue with diplomacy rules potentially re-using an existing ID
- Fix colonists starting out by grabbing a meal (they start out fed now)
- Fix clay not being usable with the builder

Optimisations
- Optimised code around ragdolls, projectiles a little
- Limit the search distance of monsters looking for alternative goals when they have a current one that's quite far away

0.9.1.1 (2023-03-17)
- Hotfix for an issue related to 1000+ long paths into colonies exposing a fresh bug that caused monsters to spawn in your safe area

0.9.1.2 (2023-03-18)
- Improve jobs searching for nearby-blocks-of-type-x (trapfixer, scribes, etc) to be more consistent in finding those blocks closer to their max range

0.9.1.3 (2023-03-18)
- Fix an out-of-bounds error mostly occuring on world load (causing siege mode)
- Fix siege mode triggering for colonies that won't have monster spawns
- Reverted unity from 2021.3.20 to 2021.3.14 because of a macOS regression

0.9.1.4 (2023-03-21)
- Fix an edge case for pathfinding related to certain path shapes next to other shapes (vague, I know, it's complicated). Should fix multiple cases of bad performance and/or siege mode in 'normal' situations.
- Fix a case where pathfinding would get stuck on the edge of the spawn area
- Fix monsters despawning 20 ingame hours into their path to the banner
- Fix colonists getting stuck doing nothing if your colony is enclosed and has no foodshops/crates/toolshops

0.9.1.5 (2023-03-21)
- Fix ingame changelog not including 0.9.1
- Fix siege mode cost continueing while paused

0.9.1.6 (2023-03-22)
- Improve spawn position selection when a lot of the unsafe zone is inaccessible with an accessible path through it, reducing chance of "siege mode flickering"

0.9.1.7 (2023-03-23)
- Fix issues with grocery/tool-shop searching when the backup case of going to the banner is still far away

0.9.1.8 (2023-03-23)
- Fix an issue with scribes not using stocked scrollshelves close to them (within 5-10 blocks)

0.9.1.9 (2023-03-27)
- Prevent siege mode from effectively creating a 'negative meals' situation
- Made the Merchant's Hub rotatable
- Fix waterpump blocks not having a collider
- "Gameplay" settings menu opens to general/gameplay settings tab instead of mouse settings
- Using the F1 quickstart menu now also pauses the game, just like the escape menu
- Don't show trap reload speed when it only holds 1 ammo
- Rename "Gunpowdertrap Ammo" to "Gunpowder Trap Ammo" for consistency sake
- Update ja-JP locale a little (via github)
